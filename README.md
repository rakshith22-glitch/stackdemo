NOTE: CORS: Extension for crome recommended if the website is giving cross origin errors


LIBRARIES USED : 
1)REACT - MUI for datatable
2)"recharts": "^2.1.12", for LINE CHART
3) AXIOS for APi CALLS
4) CORS TO REMOVE CROSS ORIGIN ERRORS



5) FRONT END AND BACKEND HAVE ARE HOSTED SEPERATELY FOR CLARITY

FRONT END LINK: https://stacklinedemo.herokuapp.com/
API -> https://stacklinebackend.herokuapp.com/data
BACKEND -> https://stacklinebackend.herokuapp.com/


6) Can implement table sorting but a little extra time would be appreciated for that.

7) WASNT ABLE TO DIRECTLY CONVERT weekEnding - "2017-01-01" -> "JAN" month to display on x axis for graph as the library wasnt supporting the conversion(so hardcoded it in the UI)
````````````````````would like inputs or suggestions if i could have approached it differently.```````````````````````````````
the process to do that would be : 
new Date('2020-12-28').toLocaleString('en-us',{month:'short'}) 

8) The website isnt MOBILE ready yet, shall make necessary adjustments
